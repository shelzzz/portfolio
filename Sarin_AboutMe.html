        <p> Hello! And welcome to my engineering portfolio. I am a junior at Dublin High School. I want to work in the technology and business field. I am currently enrolled in the Computer Science/Software class and I am a member of the Engineering Academy here in Dublin High School. I also took the Intro to Engineering Design(IED) class and Principles of Engineering(POE) class in my freshman and sophomore year.</p>
        <p> I am creative and love to work on design projects. I have a hobby of arts and crafts that comes in handy with projects. I would describe myself as innovative, artistic, cooperative, and responsible. A lot of these traits have been shown through my hobbies and in school. From working in many group projects, I have learned to be organized and cooperative. I love to read, draw/paint, watch netflix, play tennis, and code. </p>
        <p> I have had some accomplishments so far in high school. I had an internship over the summer at Cisco Systems where I worked on both a data science and a business project. In fact one of the ideas that we worked on will be integrated into the Cisco Jabber Website! I ended up making good connections with my mentors and met new friends which was really fun. I have also recieved 3rd place in the Entrepreneurship Competition at Dublin High for my team's Frost Shield project. Along with that, I have recieved the Academic Block D from my school for earning a 3.5 GPA or above for 3 semesters. Another very rewarding moment was when I got the opportunity to be a panelist at the IoT World 2017. It was great to talk about the engineering academy, the impacts of technology on education, and how we can improve education in a society where technology is rapidly advancing.</p>
        <p> Please feel free to look around my website and learn more about the work I have done surrounding engineering and technology.</p>
