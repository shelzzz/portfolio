                 <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
                 <p>Aug 30, 2017 - Sept 7, 2017</p>
                 <p class="col-sm-6"><b>Description:</b> The main objective of this project was to demonstrate our knowledge on how to use scratch by using it to create a game. Prior to and during the project, I learned how to create games using scratch. My specific role in the project was to help with designing the game and coding it on scratch. I also helped with the documentation as well. Our game was a simple jumping game with shapes where the user's objective is to jump over obstacles. It is very similar to the Google dinosaur game. The biggest challenge was that we were having trouble figuring out a way to make the obstacle repeatedly show up in a loop until the user touches the obstacle. We only used one obstacle sprite because it was much easier then making many multiple copies of the same sprite and adding it to our code. We overcame the problem effectively and found a way for the obstacle to regenerate after it left the screen to give it the illusion that there were multiple obstacles in a row. My partner and I exemplified many teamwork skills, as we were able to easily collaborate and help each other. I demonstrated leadership skills, as I made sure to delegate tasks and to keep on top of things so we were reaching our goals each day, in terms of progress on the project.

                 <h3>App Inventor Project</h3>
                 <p>Sept 19, 2017 - Oct 4, 2017</p>
                 <p class="col-sm-8"><b>Description:</b> The objective of this project was to take an already existing App Inventor tutorial game and make it more complex or original. We created the get the gold game and, although not pictured to the right, we added challenging obstacles(i.e. sharks and octopi) for the ship to avoid and added a score to accumulate how much gold was collected. I learned how to operate and code in app inventor from this project. My primary role was to help with the design and concept of the game, as well as handle the documentation. I also helped code the basic part of the game and helped debug. We were able to overcome the hardest part of the project, which was getting the obstacles to function the way they were supposed to while keeping the game still functioning properly. My partner and I exemplified many teamwork skills, as we were able to easily collaborate and help each other. I demonstrated leadership skills, as I knew how to delegate, creatively problem solve, and organize.

                 <p>Jan 12, 2018 - Jan 19, 2018</p>
                 <p class="col-sm-6"><b>Description:</b> The main objective of this project was to demonstrate our knowledge on how to use python loops to create a story game. Prior to and during the project, I learned how to create python loops and make a responsive story telling adventure game. My specific role in the project was to help with mapping out the story and creating the code in Cloud 9. Our story was a jungle adventure where the main character is on a quest to find a hidden treasure and has to go through obstacles in the jungle to fulfill the quest. The biggest challenge was that we were having trouble figuring out a way to make the raw input function properly. My partner and I exemplified many teamwork skills, as we were able to easily collaborate and help each other. I demonstrated leadership skills, as I made sure to delegate tasks and to keep on top of things so we were reaching our goals each day, in terms of progress on the project. </div>
